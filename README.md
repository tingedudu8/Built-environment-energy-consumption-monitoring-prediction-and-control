# Built-environment-energy-consumption-monitoring-prediction-and-control-

This project relies on artificial intelligence algorithms, on the basis of effective collection of building environment and energy consumption data, through deep reinforcement learning to find the optimal method, so as to build a building environment, building energy consumption prediction model and a coordinated control mechanism between the two, so as to achieve the rational use of energy, promotes the intelligent and ecological development of buildings.

## Background
The problem of high building energy consumption generally exists in large public buildings. Large public buildings generally refer to public buildings with a single building area of more than 20,000 square meters, office, commerce, tourism, science, education, culture, health, communication, and transportation hubs that use central air conditioning. Among them, large-scale office buildings are typical large-scale public buildings, which generally refer to buildings that are used for administrative affairs and various business activities for agencies, groups, enterprises and institutions, so they have the characteristics of high energy consumption of large-scale public buildings. Statistics show that the current large-scale office building area in my country is about 400-500 million square meters, accounting for about 4% of the total urban buildings in the country, but its annual power consumption accounts for 22% of the total power consumption of urban buildings in my country. According to the statistics of "China Building Energy Conservation Annual Development Research Report" over the years, the average energy consumption of large office buildings in my country is 101.77kWh/m2. The average energy consumption is 5-10 times that of urban dwellings. The energy saving potential of large office buildings is generally above 30%. Among them, in the building energy conservation problem, building energy consumption prediction has been concerned by scholars at home and abroad. Therefore, it is imperative to study building energy consumption prediction methods.

On the other hand, large office buildings are densely populated with relatively closed spaces, potentially low quality of the built environment, and the possibility of sick building syndrome. Studies have shown that effectively improving the quality of the built environment can increase the work efficiency of building personnel by 15%-20%. Therefore, the quality of the building environment is also a problem that should be attached great importance to in the development of green buildings. At present, the intelligent monitoring technology of the building environment is not perfect, and there is a lack of effective intelligent monitoring methods.

At the same time, the building itself is a complex system with multi-system coupling, nonlinearity and multi-objective, in which the building environment and building energy consumption are closely and complexly linked. The reasonable coordination state of energy saving has become one of the difficulties in the research of the industry.


## Research Status of Deep Reinforcement Learning in Building Environment and Building Energy Efficiency
The application of deep reinforcement learning in intelligent buildings has also attracted extensive attention from scholars at home and abroad. Dalamagkidis K et al. proposed to design a linear reinforcement learning controller that can supervise and control building thermal comfort, air quality, light demand, noise, etc. Compared with traditional Fuzzy-PD, its effect is better; Yu Z et al. A model-free method for online tuning of supervised fuzzy controllers for low-energy building systems using reinforcement learning, in which a Q-learning algorithm is used to monitor the building's energy system; Bielskis et al. The learning method adaptively adjusts the lighting system, thereby saving energy consumption; Li et al. proposed a grid Q-learning algorithm and applied the algorithm to the energy saving of smart buildings to solve the optimal control strategy, which is comparable to the traditional Q-learning algorithm. Compared with the -learning method, its algorithm has a faster convergence speed and better convergence performance; Bocheng proposed a multi-grid Q-learning method, which solves the approximate energy-saving optimization strategy by approximating the building environment model, and uses the initial strategy for Accurate building model, online learning optimal control strategy, and speeding up the convergence speed of the algorithm in solving practical problems; Liu.S et al. proposed a Q-learning algorithm based on reinforcement learning to supervise and control building thermal mass, thereby saving energy consumption.

As shown in the figure, the completed data acquisition module can measure humidity (envHunidity), temperature (envTemperature), atmospheric pressure (envAtmosphericPressure), carbon monoxide gas concentration (envCo), methane gas concentration (envCh4), liquefied gas concentration (envLpg), illumination Intensity (envIlluminationIntensity) and other building environment information data. The data collected by the microcontroller is wirelessly transmitted to the Raspberry Pi through the Bluetooth wireless transmission module. The Raspberry Pi unifies and organizes the format of the collected data, and then uploads the environmental information data to the server through WiFi or network cable.
